# Portfolio
With more than three years of experience as a certified Python developer, I have created web applications, data pipelines, and automated tools that address some of the modern challenges encountered while interacting with the internet. Currently, I am responsible for testing mobile and web prototypes for various software testing platforms. In this role, I conduct functional and usability tests, offer detailed feedback, and generate bug reports with clear and reproducible documentation. This portfolio was written in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a MySQL Workbench database.
